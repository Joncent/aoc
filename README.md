This is my attempt to solve the Advent of Code 2023/2024/2025 challenges. 
I am not trying to get anything done particulary nice or elegant,
I only want to get a better understanding of using a few different languages.
Since this is my first ever GitHub Repo, i am happy for any recommendations :)
Merry Christmas!
